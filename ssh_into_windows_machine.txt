Please read this first if you want ssh into windows machine or server 

First get your windows machine ip and username 

to get the ip you need to open power point with administrative mode

type power shell in your windows machine search button then right click then open with administrator 

after type ipconfig  to get the ip address

then open cmd command line you will see username not that down 

then your windows password for better security but this optional 

make sure that OpenSSH is running on your windows machine 

if its not running you can OpenSSH 

Open Powershell with Adminitrative mode or right 

Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH.Server*'

if its says Installed you are GOOD

if not you need to install it 

Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0       # to install client version 

Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0      # to install server version 


try this again 

Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH.Server*'

now it should say installed 


Start-Service sshd                       # to start ssh service 

Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'     # to start the ssh service upon starting the windows machine 


New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22       # allows incoming request 


then go into your Host machine for example Ubuntu server or Linux machine where you want to connect to the Windows Machine 

ssh <your_windows_username>@<your_windows_ip>

its will prompt  for your Windows password     ENTER IT then you are connect to your Windows machine 


There still a better way to connect to the Windows machine without prompting for Password using generating an SSH key 

+++++++++++++++++ SSH INTO WINDOWS MACHINE USING GENERATING SSH KEY ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Firstly you need to generate ssh key if you do not have one 

on your HOST machine (Ubuntu_Server) 

type :  ssh-keygen 

follow the instruction 

after copy the ssh key to your windows machine 

ssh-copy-id <your_windows_username>@<your_windows_ip>


if ssh-copy did not work you can also copy it manually 

ON your Ubuntu_server 

cd .ssh/ 
ll
cat id_rsa.pub 

copy 

then go to your windows machine 

C:\Users\<your_windows_username>\.ssh\authorized_keys 

then paste the copy id_rsa into it 

if the .ssh does not exist in your windows machine you can try create the ssh key from windows 

just open the PowerShell in administrative mode then type 

ssh-keygen 

then follow the instruction

after that copy the id_rsa.pub into your Ubuntu_Server then try to ssh into your windows machine 

ssh <windows_user_name>@<windows_ip>

then windows password should be ask enter it
